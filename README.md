# QUICKSORT

#### This is part of my master's on class Analyses and Project of Algorithms where it was required an implementation about the very famous algorithm Quicksort
#### Here you can find out some different aproaches about how to get the pivor element
## Radom
> Using a uniform distribution to find out the pivot.
## Median
> Determined by three elemnts:

```
the low boundary(lb), high boundary(hb), (lb + hb // 2)
```

## Mean
> Here was used the mean value which was riched using the formula below:

```
the low boundary(lb) + high boundary(hb) + (lb + hb // 2) // 3
```

## How to use 
> You'll find to different ways to partion arrays the [Lomuto and Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) scheme.
> You can just clone this repository and run the main.py class to plot the comparison between the related aproaches above.
